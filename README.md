# Line-following-robot
An ant-inspired autonomous robot for precise path tracking using closed-loop control. A 3-IR sensor array provides real-time position feedback, while an Arduino-based PID controller ensures smooth, accurate motion, especially on curves. The lightweight, scalable design suits warehouse automation, assistive navigation, and autonomous delivery.
Software Required: Arduino-IDE
